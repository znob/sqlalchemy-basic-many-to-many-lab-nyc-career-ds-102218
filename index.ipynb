    "In the \"One to many\" associations lab, we used SQLAlchemy to establish a \"belongs to\" and \"has many\" relationship between our `Actor` and `Role` classes.  Every instance of the Actor class had many roles, and each instance of the Role class belonged to an Actor.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this relationship might not accurately represent the equivalent real world relationship.  Although Actors do have many Roles, shouldn't a Role also have many Actors?  For instance, the role of James Bond has been played by Sean Connery, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan, and Daniel Craig.  In this lab, we will build out this \"many to many\" relationship by creating a join table called `actor_roles` containing `actor_id` and `role_id` columns.  The `actor_roles` table will only have these foreign keys, so there's no need for a full SQLAlchemy Association Object."
